  <p>
    Desktop application flow is a slightly modified version of the Client Side flow. 
		Since desktop applications, normally, do not run their own web servers, we cannot redirect back to the desktop apps. 
		Instead, we will redirect to an internal url with the returned fields. Desktop application will then listen to the browser url changes, 
		and once the url is matched, it can get the access token and other parameters.   
  </p>
  
  <h2>Authentication & Authorization</h2>
  <p> 
    To enter the authentication/authorization desktop client flow, you must poin an embedded browser to the authorization url and pass the following parameters:
		(Notice that the display parameter is set to "desktop")

    If the user is already logged in, we validate the login cookie that we have stored on the user's browser, authenticating the user. If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to enter their credentials:

  <%=image_tag("/platform/images/help/login.png", :style=>"width:600px;")%>

    Once we have successfully authenticated the user, we will prompt the user to authorize your application:

    If the user presses Don't Allow, your app is not authorized. The user will be redirected (via HTTP 302) to the URL you passed in the redirect_uri with the following error information as a URI fragment:
