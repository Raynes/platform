  	User authentication and app authorization are handled at the same time as a two step flow by redirecting the user to the Login screen, followed by the Authorization screen.

	<h2>Authentication & Authorization</h2>
	<p>	
		To enter the authentication/authorization flow, you must pass the following parameters to the authorization url:
  </p>

  <table class="documentation_table">
     <tr>

			<td>Application key generated during the app registration.</td>
			<td>true</td>
		 </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>redirect_uri</td>
      <td>Url that the user's browser will be redirected back to once app authorization is completed. You can specify this url in app settings as a Callback URL, or pass it as a paremeter. 
			If you pass it as a parameter, parameter value will be used and the app setting will be ignored. The redirect_uri must be within the same domain as the Site Domain you specify in the application settings.</td>
      <td>true</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>response_type</td>
      <td>For the server side flow the response type is defaulted to "code" and you don't need to set it.</td>
      <td>false</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>scope</td>
      <td>A comma delimited list of permissions that the application needs. By default the scope is to set to a full permission set. This is subject to change in the upcoming releases.</td>
      <td>false</td>

  <p>
    If the user is already logged in, we validate the login cookie that we have stored on the user's browser, authenticating the user. If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to enter their credentials:
  </p>  
	
	<center>
	<%=image_tag("/platform/images/help/login.png", :style=>"width:600px;")%>
	</center>
	
	<p>
		Once we have successfully authenticated the user, we will prompt the user to authorize your application:
	</p>
	
  <center>
  <%=image_tag("/platform/images/help/authorize.png", :style=>"width:600px;")%>
  </center>
  
	<p>
    If the user presses Don't Allow, your app is not authorized. The user will be redirected (via HTTP 302) to the URL you passed in the redirect_uri parameter with the following error information:
  </p>

  <div class="code_snippet">
    http://YOUR_URL?status=unauthorized&message=user+canceled
	</div>
		
	<p>	
    If the user presses Allow, your app is authorized. The user will be redirected (via HTTP 302) to the URL you passed in the redirect_uri parameter with an authorization code:
  </p>

  <div class="code_snippet">
    http://YOUR_URL?code=A_CODE_GENERATED_BY_SERVER&expires_in=SECONDS_UNTIL_THE_CODE_IS_EXPIRED
  </div>

	<p>
    With this code in hand, you can proceed to the next step, app authentication, to gain the access token you need to make API calls.
  </p>

  <h2>Application Authorization</h2>
	
  <p>  
    In order to authenticate your app, you must pass the following parameter to the request_token endpoint: 
  </p>

     <tr>
      <td>client_secret</td>
      <td>Application secret generated during the registration process and availble in the application settings.
			   The app secret is available from the Developer App and should not be shared with anyone or embedded in any code that you will distribute 
				 (you should use the client-side flow for these scenarios).

    If your app is successfully authenticated and the authorization code from the user is valid, the authorization server will return the access token in a JSON format:

    If your app failed to provide appropriate parameters, you will get one of the errors below in JSON format:
